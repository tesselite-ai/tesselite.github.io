# Tesselite.App


*"Race your deployments. Build the best of your product. Your real champion."*

We demonstrate Tesselite motto with the very website of Tesselite.

We race different versions of Tesselite website. 

Those versions are different on many layers:

- different philosophy


- different implementation(s)


- different deployment(s)


We race those versions concurrently and let Tesselite algorithm arbitrate.

### Race philosophy

Think of the race as this story:

*"You want to deploy a website. You want to serve the best version to your customers.<br><br>
. Your frontend team come up with many ideas. <br>
. You would like also to give a shoot to an external company with very capable team.<br>
. You want a website that will have a low maintenance cost.<br><br>
You have to cut a mid-line and decide what to serve to your customer. In old-fashioned legacy mindset, you will make 100 appointments, 3 prototypes. Spend a lot of time back and forth to finally decide to trust a team.<br><br>
In the Artificial Intelligence era, you have an optimization problem. You don't need to guess out a solution. Let an A.I. algorithm decide what is the best fit, the best solution to your problem.<br><br>
In the Tesselite era, the computation is done in real-time with live data. The customers decide themselves what is the best solution, the best version of your product. Not you. Not your team.<br><br>
In the Tesselite era, your team has to put out more work, more alternatives, more innovations. Your team has to improve features customers really want. 
Your team has to demonstrate to the algorithm that latest updates really bring value to the customer. Before, the algorithm propagates updates.
Tesselite algorithm assign you to build better products."*
